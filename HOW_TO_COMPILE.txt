==========
GNU/Linux:
==========

1) Get CMake 2.6 or a higher version

2) Get the folowing libraries: 
 * libsdl1.2-dev
 * libsdl-image1.2-dev
 * libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
 * libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

3) Download and compile UGDK with static link type:
- a. Download https://github.com/uspgamedev/ugdk/tarball/v0.3.0
- b. Check the provided HOW_TO_COMPILE for instructions on how to compile UGDK.
- c. Copy ugdk/lib/libugdk.a to horus_eye/lib

3) Open a terminal in the same folder of this file.

4) $ cmake . (Do not forget the '.' at the end)
   $ make horus_eye

Optionally, you can use CMake to generate files for your favorite IDE. Search
for cmake -G options.

========
Mac OS X
========

1) Install CMake 2.6 or a higher version

2) Install the following libraries: 
- SDL 1.2
- SDL_Image 1.2
- SDL_Mixer 1.2
- SDL_TTF 2.0

3) Download and compile UGDK with static (or dynamic) link type:
- a. Download https://github.com/uspgamedev/ugdk/tarball/v0.3.0
- b. Check the provided HOW_TO_COMPILE for instructions on how to compile UGDK.
- c. Copy ugdk/lib/libugdk.a (or ugdk/lib/libugdk.dylib, if you compiled 
     a dynamic library) to horus_eye/lib

4) Open a Terminal in the same folder of this file.

5) Type the following command at the terminal:
   ./deploy/deploy_macosx.sh

The file "Horus Eye.app" will be created inside the deploy folder.

If you want to compile a deployment version (for distribution), you must follow
the instructions on how to compile a Universal Binary in UGDK, and follow the
instructions in the file ./deploy/HOW_TO_DEPLOY.txt

Optionally, you can use CMake to generate files for your favorite IDE. Search
for cmake -G options. But please note that this feature is not supported by us,
so you may have some trouble compiling it this way.

=======
Windows
=======

On Windows, there's a provided Visual Studio 2010 solution. You must have the 
following headers and libraries installed:
- SDL 1.2
- SDL_Image 1.2
- SDL_Mixer 1.2
- SDL_TTF 2.0

You will need to compile the UGDK and copy lib/Release/libugdk.lib to the horus_eye/lib folder.
UGDK source: https://github.com/uspgamedev/ugdk/zipball/v0.3.0

If you wish to use MinGW, feel free to generate the Makefile project using CMake.
You can either use the cmake-gui or open a command prompt in the same folder of 
this HOW_TO and run: cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" .

Although CMake has support to generate Visual Studio project files, we have reports
it doesn't work with our script.
