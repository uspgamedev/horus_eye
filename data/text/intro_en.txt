A long time ago, in a village at ancient Egypt, peace reigned absolutely.

But one night, the evil spirit of an ancient Pharaoh escaped from the kingdom of the dead and returned to the nearby pyramid.

Planning to domain Egypt once again, the Pharaoh started giving life to the mummies of his fallen warriors.

However, Horus, the god of Sky, noticed the escape of the Pharaoh and sent to Earth a magical relic to help men defend their world. That relic was a bracelet with a very powerful jewel: the Horus' Eye.

In order to accomplish this hard and dangerous task, a young boy called Kha was chosen by his bravery and pure heart.

Now, Kha's mission is to defeat the mummy warriors inside the pyramid and ban the evil Pharaoh from Earth.
