following headers and libraries installed:
- SDL 1.2
- SDL_Image 1.2
- SDL_Mixer 1.2
- SDL_TTF 2.0

You will need to compile the UGDK and copy lib/Release/libugdk.lib to the horus_eye/lib folder.

If you wish to use MinGW, feel free to generate the Makefile project using CMake.
You can either use the cmake-gui or open a command prompt in the same folder of 
this HOW_TO and run: cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" .

Although CMake has support to generate Visual Studio project files, we have reports
it doesn't work with our script.
