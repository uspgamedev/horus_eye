A long time ago, in a village at ancient Egypt, peace reigned absolute.
But one night, the evil spirit of an ancient Pharaoh escaped from the death kingdom and returned to the pyramid at that region.
Planning to domain Egypt once again, the Pharaoh started giving life to the mummies of his fallen warrios in the pyramid.
However, Horus, the god of sky, noticed the scape of Pharaoh and sent to Earth a magical relic to help men defend their world. A bracelet with a very powerful jewel: the Horus' Eye.
In order to accomplish this hard and dangerous task, a young boy called Kah was chosen by his bravery and pure heart.
Now, Kha's mission is to defeat the mummy warrios inside the pyramid and ban the evil Pharaoh from Earth.
