==========
GNU/Linux:
==========

1) Get CMake 2.6 or a higher version

2) Get the folowing libraries: libSDL-1.2, libSDL_image-1.2, libSDL_mixer-1.2 and
libSDL_ttf-1.2

3) Download and compile UGDK with static link type:
- a. Download https://github.com/uspgamedev/ugdk/tarball/v0.1
- b. $ cmake -DLINK_TYPE=STATIC -DBUILD_TYPE=RELEASE .
     $ make
- c. Copy ugdk/lib/ugdk.a to horus_eye/lib

3) Open a terminal in the same folder of this HOW_TO.

4) $ cmake . (Do not forget the '.' at the end)
   $ make horus_eye
   # make install

Optionally, you can use CMake to generate files for your favorite IDE. Search
for cmake -G options.

Windows
=======

On Windows, there's a provided Visual Studio 2010 solution. You must have the 
following headers and libraries installed:
- SDL 1.2
- SDL_Image 1.2
- SDL_Mixer 1.2
- SDL_TTF 1.2

You will need to compile the UGDK and copy lib/Release/ugdk.lib to the horus_eye/lib folder.
UGDK source: https://github.com/uspgamedev/ugdk/tarball/v0.1

If you wish to use MinGW, feel free to generate the Makefile project using CMake.
You can either use the cmake-gui or open a command prompt in the same folder of 
this HOW_TO and run: cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" .

Although CMake has support to generate Visual Studio project files, we have reports
it doesn't work with our script.
