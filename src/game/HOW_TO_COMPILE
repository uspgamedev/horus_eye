Windows

On Windows, you can configure your IDE by your own or use CMake to generate
the Makefiles or your favorite IDE files.
**Our CMake files were not completely test on Windows**.
But, CMake is really cool ;) and you can try this:

Open a shell prompt, go to horus_eye\trunk\src\game and:

a) If you use MinGW command line:
cmake -G "MinGW Makefiles" .       (Do not forget the '.' at the end)

b) If you use Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express:
cmake -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" .  (Notice the '.' at the end)

c) If you use anything else, search about other options with cmake -G command.
